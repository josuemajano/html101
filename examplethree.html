    <h1>This example is about maling lists</h1>
    <h2>Here's what I like about lists:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When you make a list, do it in this order</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
        <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items<li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li> 

        </li>
        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>
